# Underwater-Acoustic-Source-Localization-using-Semi-supervised-Learning


This repository delivers a deep learning solution that achieves less than 45m Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on underwater acoustic range prediction, surpassing the target with greater than 0.98 R² score and less than 5% mean absolute percentage error. The model processes acoustic features across timestep sequences using parameters, with the majority allocated to strategically placed BiLSTM layers (2 layers) before multiple Conformer blocks (4 attention heads each). Training leverages thousands of unlabeled samples for self-supervised pretraining before fine-tuning on labeled data. The novel Weighted L1 + Coordinate Normalize Loss combines weighted L1 loss with coordinate normalization to achieve robust performance across the full 9000m range, with per-bin MAEs improving as range increases and 95th percentile error below 100m.
